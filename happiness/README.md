<h5>This heatmap visualizes the correlation coefficients between various socioeconomic and well-being indicators across different countries or regions. The values range from -1 to 1, with red indicating a strong negative correlation, blue indicating a strong positive correlation, and the lighter shades representing weaker relationships.</h5>

- Starting from the top, we can see that the "year" feature has a strong positive correlation (1.0) with itself, as expected. This is because the year is inherently correlated with itself.

- Looking at the `Life Ladder` feature, which represents a measure of life satisfaction, we can see that it has a moderate positive correlation (around 0.7-0.8) with `Log GDP per capita` and `Social support`. This suggests that higher levels of economic development and social support are associated with greater life satisfaction.

- Interestingly, `Life Ladder` has a moderate negative correlation (around -0.3 to -0.4) with `Perceptions of corruption` and "Negative affect". This indicates that countries or regions with higher perceptions of corruption and more negative emotional experiences tend to have lower levels of life satisfaction.

- The `Healthy life expectancy at birth` feature has a strong positive correlation (1.0) with itself, as expected. It also shows a moderate positive correlation (around 0.6-0.8) with `Log GDP per capita` and `Social support`, suggesting that economic development and social support are linked to improved health outcomes.

- The `Freedom to make life choices` indicator has a strong positive correlation (1.0) with the `Generosity` feature, indicating that countries or regions with greater individual freedoms tend to have more generous populations.

- The `Perceptions of corruption` feature has a strong negative correlation (-1.0) with itself, as well as moderate negative correlations (around -0.3 to -0.4) with `Log GDP per capita`, `Healthy life expectancy at birth`, and `Freedom to make life choices`. This suggests that perceived corruption is associated with lower levels of economic development, health outcomes, and personal freedoms.

- Finally, the `Positive affect" and "Negative affect" features have a strong negative correlation (-1.0) with each other, as one would expect, as they represent positive and negative emotional experiences, respectively.

<h5>Overall, this correlation heatmap provides valuable insights into the complex relationships between various socioeconomic and well-being indicators across different countries or regions. It highlights the interdependencies and potential drivers of these indicators, which could be useful for researchers, policymakers, and analysts working to understand and improve societal outcomes.</h5>
